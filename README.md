Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client DriverPass wanted a system designed to handle training students for their driving tests. 

What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job understanding the client's needs, and translating those into clearly defined system requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would add more explanations of technical details, and make it more friendly for a non-techincal audience.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs were implemented into the system design by providing all the features described in the interview with the client. It is important to consider the user's needs as ultimately they are the people who the projects success or failure will be decided by.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software from a user focused place, empathetic place. Great software is built with user's needs placed first and foremost. I think using UML class, sequence, and activity diagrams are all great ways to analyze and design a system.
